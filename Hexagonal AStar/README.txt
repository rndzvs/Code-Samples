This folder contains a code snippet of my implementation of the A* pathing algorithm for a hexagonal coordinate system.
As it is a code sample snippet, it mainly focuses on the function implementation rather than producing an executable file.

HexagonalAStar.cpp -
    Contains the A* implementation function:
        list<Point> HexagonalAStar(Point start, Point end)

node.h and point.h -
    Contain implementations of small helper classes that are used in the A* function.
